# Nexmo NCCO Examples

Welcome! Here you will find some examples of NCCOs (Nexmo Call Control Objects) that you can use with the [Nexmo Voice API](https://developer.nexmo.com/voice/voice-api/overview). We've split the examples into sections so have a browse and if you don't find what you're looking for, [open an issue](https://github.com/nexmo-community/ncco-examples/issues) (pull requests are welcome too!).

## Talking

These examples use the `talk` action, producing text-to-speech output.

* [`talk.json`](talk.json) for simple spoken words
* [`text-to-speech.json`](text-to-speech.json) also specifies a [voice name](https://developer.nexmo.com/voice/voice-api/guides/text-to-speech#voice-names)
* [`ssml.json`](ssml.json) has an example with some [SSML (Synthesized Speech Markup Language)](https://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis11/) for expression.

## Telephone

* [`connect-phone.json`](connect-phone.json) to connect the answered call to another number
* [`conference.json`](conference.json) to add every user to the same conference
* [`dtmf-input.json`](dtmf-input.json) if you want to get the user to enter some digits with their telephone keypad
